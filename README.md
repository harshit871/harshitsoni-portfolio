# Frontend Developer Portfolio

This is the README file for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills and projects as a Frontend Developer. 
The website is built using Next.js with app routing, Tailwind CSS for styling, TypeScript for enhanced code quality, GSAP for animations, and Prismic as the headless CMS.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations.

- **Prismic**: A headless CMS that allows content creators to define their own data structure.

## Project Structure

- **/pages**: Contains the Next.js pages for different sections of the website.

- **/styles**: Includes stylesheets written in Tailwind CSS.

- **/components**: Reusable React components used across the site.

- **/public**: Houses static assets like images, fonts, etc.

- **/utils**: Utility functions and helper files.
